## 🎯 Overview

In 2025, Ghana announced a 15% reduction in public transport fares to ease the burden of rising fuel prices. But on the ground, commuters experienced something different: fare manipulation, unapproved route changes, and a broken enforcement system.

This scroll-driven visual story combines satellite imagery, live map transitions, and commuter testimony to expose the real cost of a fare cut that never reached most passengers.

---

## 🚍 What the Visualisation Shows

- Satellite route from **Kasoa** to **Circle**, segmented into fare manipulation hotspots
- Sticky, animated Mapbox scenes that reveal:
  - Where the announced fare cut was ignored
  - How routes were unofficially shortened mid-journey
  - Visual markers of every key bus stop along the route
- Field photos
  - An interactive journey where the map responds to the story

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Mapbox GL JS v2.15**
- **Scrollama.js** for scroll-triggered map animations
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- Satellite screenshots captured and matched to commuter routes

---

## 🛡️ Access Token Safety

To protect the Mapbox access token:
- `config.js` does not expose secrets
- A local-only `secrets.js` is used during development
- `.gitignore` ensures private keys never reach the public repo

## 🏆 Why This Project Matters

This project isn't just about transport. It’s about **accountability, enforcement, and survival** in an economy where policy doesn't always translate to lived experience.

It aims to elevate data-driven storytelling in Ghana and across Africa — blending maps, narrative, and evidence into an immersive reader journey.
