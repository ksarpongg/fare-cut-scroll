      <section id="slide1" class="step">A nation on the move. Ghana’s transport system stretches across forests, cities, and coastlines, carrying hopes, goods, and grievances.</section>
      <section id="slide2" class="step">Ghana’s most densely populated region moves millions every day, but when systems break, this is where the fractures show.</section>
      <section id="slide3" class="step">This fast-growing town sits on the edge of Accra, a transport lifeline between the capital and the Central Region. Yet it’s where a new kind of manipulation begins.</section>
      <section id="slide4" class="step">One journey, many fares. The fare cut promised 'relief'. But for commuters, it’s more confusion, more cash and no change...</section>
      <section id="slide5" class="step">Now, drivers insist on stopping mid route and charging a new fare. What used to be a checkpoint is now a new fare point.</section>
      <section id="slide6" class="step">From Old Barrier to Mallam junction — another fare, another delay, another hustle.</section>
      <section id="slide7" class="step">Commuters are told it’s a “different route.” The vehicle is the same. The story isn’t.</section>
      <section id="slide8" class="step">There’s no notice, no official fare list — just the voice of the mate shouting a new route.</section>
      <section id="slide9" class="step">It’s still the same trotro, same driver. But fares climb like clockwork.</section>
      <section id="slide10" class="step">Another GHC 3.50. What was GH¢10 after the fare cut is now GH¢17 — same road, different rules.</section>
      <section id="slide11" class="step">The bus arrives. The money is gone and the silence costs more than the fare.</section>
